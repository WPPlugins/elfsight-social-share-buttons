The Elfsight Social Share buttons is amazingly easy to configure not only for experienced users, but even for newbies. The provided combination of settings allows everyone to find their perfect setup, and so we’ve decided to give you a brief walk-through the settings to give you a better idea of how to achieve the best desired effect.

Now we’d like to take a look at each tab together with you, and find out exactly how, where and in what manner to configure your perfect Share buttons widget.

The Elfsight Share Buttons app has four groups of settings, each on their own tab – Networks, Layout, Buttons and Style. Let’s go over each of them, and examine the functionality they allow to implement.

The first settings tab is Networks. As the name suggests, this is where you select the networks to display on your website. Selecting and setting the network is amazingly easy. To do it, you only need to press “Add” button and select the required network from the list. We’re really eager to make this app as customizable as possible, so we let you choose the text on the button. You can either have the name of the social media displayed on it, which is the default variant, or enter the text you prefer to Text field, and it will be displayed on the button instead of the name.

The Layout tab offers some pretty interesting options of positioning your buttons on the page. The first option you’ll see is Locations, it provides you with the choice between inline and floating buttons. Inline widget stays fixed in the place you put them to, and floating ones scroll along with the page. Position option lets you choose where to place the widget – on the right of your webpage, on the left or in the center. On the Layout tab you can also set your buttons' grid, that is, set the gutter around them in pixels. You can either keep the auto option, as the widget automatically calculates its size to fit your page in the best possible way, but if you need to set custom gutter size, all you need to do is enter the dimensions in pixels to the required field.Also, on this tab you can disable the buttons for mobile devices. “Hide on Mobile” button allows you to do that.

The Buttons tab, predictably, is all about the Buttons' appearance. The Elements field offers you two settings – Icon and Text. If you only check Icon, the button will display the network’s logo only. If you check text, the button will either display the network’s name, or the custom text you’ve set on Layout tab. You can check both options, and then your button will feature both the logo and the text. Also, you can choose the shape of your buttons – rectangular, rounded and circle. If you need to change the width of your widget, you can set the required width in pixels on this tab, as well!

The Style tab allows you to set the buttions' Styles, Colors, Animation and Transparency. Configuring them is just as easy as configuring the other Share buttons widget settings.
